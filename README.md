# Planto app 🌱

🪴 Planto is A simple and elegant iOS app built with SwiftUI, helping users keep track of their plants — where they are, how much light they need, and when to water them.

## ✨Features

-Add new plant reminders with name, room, light preference, and watering schedule.
-Edit plants or swipe to delete.
-“All done” screen when every plant is watered.
-Notifications that remind users to water their plant.

## 🧩Architecture

This project follows the MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) pattern:
Model: PlantReminder — holds plant data
ViewModel: ContentViewModel and SetReminderViewModel — handles logic and data updates
Views (Planto): ListRemindersView, SetReminderView, EditPlantView, and so on.

## 🧠 How it works:
-Tap + to add a new plant.
-Enter details (room, light, watering days, and water amount).
-Mark reminders complete as you water your plants.
-When all are complete, an animated “All Done” screen appears.
-You can delete the plant by swiping or if you want to edit a plant you can click on it and then you can start editing.
